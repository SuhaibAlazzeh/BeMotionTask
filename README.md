#Dependencies 
This project uses the following dependencies:

- Firebase
Firebase is used to handle user authentication.

Firebase Authentication: Manages user login, registration, and sign-out functionality.

Used for logging users in with email and password (Auth.auth().signIn(withEmail:password:)).
Used for registering users if they donâ€™t exist (Auth.auth().createUser(withEmail:password:)).

- SwiftUI
The app is built entirely with SwiftUI, Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces.

SwiftUI: Framework used for building the app's UI declaratively.
NavigationView and NavigationLink are used for handling navigation.
Views like TextField, SecureField, and Button are used for input fields and actions.
